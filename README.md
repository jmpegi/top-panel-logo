- From [GitHub](https://github.com/jmpegi/top-panel-logo):

  1. Clone this repo to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/top-panel-logo@jmpegi.github.com`.
  2. Restart GNOME Shell (logout or reboot).
  3. Enable the extension.

     NOTE: You can also install the extension system-wide by placing it in `/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/top-panel-logo@jmpegi.github.com` instead. This is not recommended.

## üí° Tips

- Most GNU/Linux distributions store their logo somewhere inside `/usr/share/pixmaps/` or `/usr/share/icons/`

- For ease of use, disable 'Hot Corner' under 'GNOME Settings/Multitasking'.

- To prevent gnome-terminal from automatically closing when running a custom command, use:  
`gnome-terminal -- bash -c 'yourcommand; wait'` or
`gnome-terminal -- bash -c 'yourcommand; exec bash'` or  
`gnome-terminal -- bash -c 'yourcommand; read -p "Press ENTER to close...'`
